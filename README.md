# Standing-Waves
Pure Data patches to create resonant frequencies in a room

The wave calculator will determine the frequency of all the possible standing waves in a room. You must input the temperature first to determine the speed of sound and then input the dimensions of the room. Then you can click through the Hradios and it will output the frequencies in the first 9 modes.

I also created a patch to use a korg midi drum pad controller to be able to launch the Hradios for live performances. But it is not necessary. It splits the korg into the two rows and the different registers to control different Hradios.

The notes patch is a recent addition to help with being able to mix the waves together in consonance. It outputs a note name based on what the frequency is closer to in western scale. I will add a patch soon that also tells how far it is out of tune from these notes.
